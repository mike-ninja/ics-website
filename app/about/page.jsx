                The absolute core and soul of our company is our people and
                culture. We believe that the people who make up ICS have a
                commitment to First Nations affairs both through their work life
                and experiences. Over the years, we have built the most
                experienced Indigenous Conference Management team so much so
                that since opening our doors, we have clocked up an impressive
                array of events both within Australia and internationally. ICS
                has organized conferences up to 6,500 delegates, festivals up to
                70,000 over two (2) days and thousands of smaller conferences
                and events. We offer community organizations a wide range of
                services from total event management to marketing, offering
                perks and free of charge services for sourcing conference venues
                amongst others.
              </p>

                ICS is based upon the principles of maintaining our own Cultural
                identity whilst striving for our own self-determination through
                education & private enterprise. ICS is by far the longest,
                professional, independent (not relying on government funding)
                event management company in First Nations Australia. We are
                proud of our heritage which when coupled with our unyielding
                drive and determination, we generally achieved and obtain the
                highest standard of professional event management service.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe education is the key to generational change and a
                brighter future, and we are deeply committed to the ongoing
                success of Indigenous independence through private enterprise
                and the fostering and nurturing of partnerships. Through
                developing partnerships with community organizations, ICS funds
                conferences without sourcing funding from government departments
                and organizations. This enables community groups the opportunity
                to stage a conference or event without 'going cup in hand'
                seeking funding. A further benefit of an ICS funded event is the
                freedom to place on the event agenda specific issues prevalent
                to the partnered organization. All ICS events are what is termed
                public interest and have deep grounding with grassroots
                principles.

                Our Koori CEO, Tom Callaghan comes from Kempsey in Dunghutti
                country of NSW. We specialize in working with NGOs and
                governments and initiated several successful events over the
                years. Our events are designed to be an information sharing
                platform for not only open and frank discussion but also based
                upon the principles of Indigenous self-determination through the
                sharing of positive information, programs and cooperation
                between community organizations and governments. Moreover, if a
                national association is not funded to run an event, we will lend
                our support and expertise to help develop the conference. Our
                business model is successful and well-proven; hence, ICS
                continues to save organization's money, time and resources. The
                ICS business model has work both nationally and internationally
                for many years no. Fundamental to this is remaining neutral and
                outside political agendas and without fear of losing funding.
              </p>
              <p>
                We do not enter into government politics, nor were wishing to
                develop a profile that will interfere or cut across any
                community groupâ€™s philosophy or beliefs. Our sole aim is to
                bring together information that can be disseminated for the
                better good of Indigenous communities. It is our plan to be
                recognized as a network sharing tools and a provider of quality
                conferences and seminars that enhances local and government
                organization with quality speakers and training programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our conferences are not political based rather should be seen as
                an opportunity to access information that is not readily
                available at your own level. Today, the world has become smaller
                with the invention of the internet however the internet has also
                managed to sterilised and isolate people at the same time. As
                such, we are of the belief that there is nothing more empowering
                and more efficient than for workers to have an opportunity to
                network and meet face to face to exchange ideas, valuable
                information and successful programs in place in their
                communities. For more information, please do not hesitate to
                contact us anytime.
